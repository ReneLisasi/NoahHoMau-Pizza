Task description:

SWE 3313 Project Description - Pizza 
 You are to design a pizza order and delivery system for a new Pizza Shop.  This is a brand new, "Mom 
and Pop" type, start-up operation.  This shop is a pickup or delivery only business-- there is no 
restaurant dining.  You are to design the whole computer system that will set up new customers, take 
orders, calculate bills, process payments, and contain the restaurant menu.   The following information is known:  1.  You will set up a record for each new customer.  This information will be keyed by customer phone 
number.  Put information into the master record such as name, address, phone and type of charge 
account (Visa/ MasterCard).  You also need to record pertinent information for locating the address 
(i.e., subdivision name, closest major intersection, etc.)  2.  Your system needs to process payments in the form of checks, cash or credit cards.  You will need 
to keep track of the type of payment made and the amount.   3.  Users will access the customer database for all customer transactions.  The information should 
come up for already established customers showing their address and delivery information.  4.  Your system should be able to print out a receipt of the order with a place to sign the form by the 
customer if it is on a credit card.  This should have customer information, a list of items ordered, if it is 
for delivery or pickup, and amount due.  5.  Your system should contain the complete restaurant menu for order-taking purposes.  The user 
needs to have GUI access to the various menu items and be able to quickly enter the desired orders.  
This menu needs to have various sizes of pizzas, the typical types of toppings, various crust options, 
and beverages.  The customer should be able to order things like a medium, thin crust pizza, with 
pepperoni and extra cheese.  This domain should be very familiar to you and if not, what better area to 
“research”?  Your team will conduct 2 “sprints” to develop software for specific components of the project.  The following represents the physical documentation you must submit to support your system.  
I.  Project Plan: 
     The project plan must consist of the following components:           1.  Scope            2.  Schedule (including work breakdown structure, milestones and/or deliverables,   
               and a Gantt chart)           3.  Team organization (including resumes of the team members)            4.  Technical description of the system 
          5.  Data management plan            6.  Test plan   
II.  Requirements Documents:  The requirements documents will consist of the following:           1.  Requirements definition document            2.  Requirements specification document  Your documents should include the following:   
• Requirements Definition: 
o English text, include functional and non-functional requirements 
• Requirements specification document: 
o Use case diagram (created by a drawing tool or Dia) 
o Use case flow of events document (text document, created in Word) 
o Class diagrams (created in Dia) 
o Class documentation (created in Word) 
o Entity relationship diagram(s) (created by a drawing tool or DB tool) 
o one of the following (for documenting classes):                either decision table(s) or state transition diagram(s)           
III. System Design Documents:    The system design documents will consist of the following: 
• Conceptual system design: 
o Report formats (created in Word) e.g. register receipt, order slip, daily business 
report/summary 
o Screen layouts/shots (screen captures from your prototype embedded in a text 
document guiding the user through the application, with the requirements and use 
cases being addressed by each screen clearly identified on the bottom of the page – 
underneath the screenshot) 
• Technical design: (high level) 
o Detailed class diagrams with all methods, attributes and relationships identified 
with supporting text specification (created in Word) 
o Database table descriptions 
• Technical Support Specifications 
o A summary of the technical support that the user can expect.  It should include the 
various levels of support in conjunction with the time frame of availability.    
Additional requirements: 
 1.  Each group must take minutes of each meeting (those IN CLASS as well as OUTSIDE OF 
CLASS), including attendance.  These minutes must be included in the appendix.   2.  Each group must prepare weekly status reports that document the status of all activities your group 
is currently working on.  Include what each person has contributed that week as well an assessment of 
the percentage completed for each activity.  These reports must be included in the appendix of the 
notebook and I may ask to see them at any point in the term, so keep them up-to-date.   3.  Each team member must keep track of the time they spend working on the project.  Include all 
time spent on a weekly time sheet, and identify which activities you were working on.  (This 
information will be summarized for each team member on the weekly status report.)  These individual 
time sheets must be included in the appendix and I may ask to see them at any point in the term, so 
keep them up-to-date.    4.  Your final notebook must look professional; must include all clean, final documents, and have all 
marked-up documents placed in a section of the notebook (or in a sleeve); must have an appropriate 
coversheet (with team name and team members identified) and must include a table-of-contents.
